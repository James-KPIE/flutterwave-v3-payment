# flutterwave_payment

A new Flutter plugin for flutterwave payment integration
This fluterwave_payment plugin is a fork from - [rave_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/rave_flutter) plugin which is no longer being updated so flutterwave_payment is born to fix a lot of issues within it. 

This is a stable version of the payment gateway with more functionalities still to come.

## Installation
To use this plugin, add `flutterwave_payment` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

Webview is required so enable `PlatformView` on iOS by adding:

```
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/
```
to Info.plist file

## Making Payment
Instantiate `RavePayInitializer` and pass it to `RavePayManager.prompt` along
with the `BuildContext`. The result of the transaction is the `Future` 
returned by `RavePayManager.initialize`

```
processTransaction() async {
    // Get a reference to RavePayInitializer
    var initializer = RavePayInitializer(
        amount: 500, publicKey: publicKey, encryptionKey: encryptionKey)
      ..country = "NG"
      ..currency = "NGN"
      ..email = "customer@email.com"
      ..fName = "Ciroma"
      ..lName = "Adekunle"
      ..narration = narration ?? ''
      ..txRef = txRef
      ..subAccounts = subAccounts
      ..acceptMpesaPayments = acceptMpesaPayment
      ..acceptAccountPayments = acceptAccountPayment
      ..acceptCardPayments = acceptCardPayment
      ..acceptAchPayments = acceptAchPayments
      ..acceptGHMobileMoneyPayments = acceptGhMMPayments
      ..acceptUgMobileMoneyPayments = acceptUgMMPayments
      ..staging = true
      ..isPreAuth = preAuthCharge
      ..displayFee = shouldDisplayFee;

    // Initialize and get the transaction result
    RaveResult response = await RavePayManager()
        .prompt(context: context, initializer: initializer);
  }
 ```
